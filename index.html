        <p>I'm 28 and from Ghent. I studied audiology. Audiologists are the guys (well, mostly women) that do hearing  tests and help your grandmother get hearing aids. I am currently (until 2 days before the start of the java academy) working in a children's hospital, which basically means I play games with small children all day.
        </p>

        <p>Before this, I've worked as a product specialist for a hearing aid manufacturer, I've worked with an NGO in Brazil doing hearing screenings, and I lived in Honduras for a while working as a divemaster.</p>
        <p>I developed an interest in coding while living in Brazil where it was much too hot to do anything for most of the day, and I had no internet but did have a laptop, a kindle with some books about linux and python, and a lot of free time.</p>
        <p>Some of my main hobbies/interests are diving, cooking, pretentious literature and arty-farty movies.</p>
