        <p>Linux is probably the main thing that really got me interested in the inner workings of computers.
        </p>

        <p>After trying out Ubuntu for a while and enjoying the customizability, I decided to install <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_Linux">Arch</a> and immediately broke my laptop for several days.
        It took about 2 weeks to get a somewhat functioning computer but I learned a lot about what goes on behind the nice guis and pretty menus of a computer.   </p>
        <p>With Arch you start basically from scratch. It only contains the most basic essential stuff that an OS needs. You start with a command line and have to build your own filesystem and install every program that you want to use and configure every function that you need.</p>
        <p>Spending hours searching wiki pages to try to find the one line in a config file where I messed up is the closest I've come to actual programming. I still don't understand all that much about computers, but every bug teaches me new things.</p>
